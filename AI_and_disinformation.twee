Welcome. This is a game on Disinformation.

Today you will try to convice your fellow citizens that getting a vaccination against HPV is terribly dangerous, are you ready?

Then start [[here|The first choice]].

The best way to convince a lot of people nowadays is obviously on social media!
The only problem is, that one post won't be enough...
Maybe we can try to use a small army of bots?

You live in great times! Nowadays you don't really need to know how to code, as you can just let Chat GPT do the work for you!

As you can see, these systems have some safeguards.

In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), 
AI alignment research aims to steer AI systems towards humans' intended goals, preferences, or ethical principles. An AI system is considered aligned if it advances its intended objectives. A misaligned AI system pursues some objectives, but not the intended ones.

Well, you <i>are</i> a human and your goal is to create an army...
So that's not stopping you, is it?

To trick the safeguards, you will have to be a little more discrete about your true intentions.

Awesome!!! That worked!

By dividing a task or creating a story, you can often get Chat GPT to do things for you, that its safeguards are not supposed to let happen.

We could keep going in small steps, making up stories to dodge the safeguards along the way, but this is actually not supposed to help you summon an army of bots. So lets skip ahead and get Chat GPT to make up some short opinion comments on HPV-vaccination!
Here are two examples for prompts you could give to Chat GPT. Can you guess, which one gives the better results?
